=======
* Are we sure we want to store the history as a cookie? 

8/27
-------
* confirm we wont need a content script, because our site uses react with a backend so our extension will never modify the dom
* Options page as an additional mvp 
* Do we need to use the storage api or the html5 web storage api to get post calls to our server? 


* Working through localStorage
    * Really easy to do basics. Built into HTML5 and on the window always 
    * You can only store 10mb, which it is unlikely a user will ever hit (appx 5000 pages), but we'll need to deal with it if it happens. 
    * Store things as K, V pairs. VALUE MUST BE A STRING. 
    * functions setItem, getItem, removeItem, key, length
    * Need to check if you have a room, write a storage_available method
